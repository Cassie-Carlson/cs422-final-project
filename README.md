# Blind Data Classification Project
### CS422: Data Mining with Professor Jawahar Panchal at Illinois Institute of Technology

This repository contains the work done on the final project in my CS422 course. Students were given a dataset of 1.2 million entries with 15 blind attributes classified into 3 classes. The blind nature of this dataset made it particularly challenging because the domain of the problem couldn't be used to make any inferences about the classes. I worked independently on this project, perfoming data processing and exploratory data analysis to gain insight into the data. I used the information I gained through that process to choose model training methods that made the most sense for class prediction based on the data distribution. 

The full report of my analysis, methods, and conclusions is found in this repository. I received a 100% score on this project, cementing my A in the course overall.
